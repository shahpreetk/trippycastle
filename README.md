# 🏰 Trippy Castle

### 👩‍🏫 Project Brief

Your team is being asked to develop an app to allow University students to plan a day trip using local bus services to one of the following historic castles:
• Alnwick Castle
• Auckland Castle
• Bamburgh Castle
• Barnard Castle
Each day trip will start and end at either Newcastle Haymarket Bus Station or Newcastle Eldon Square Bus Station depending on the castle visited.

### 🛠 Built with

UI - The prototyping and designing of the website was done on Adobe XD.

Frontend - The frontend of this journey planning system is made using the Reactjs UI library. It helps in making a single-page application (SPA) that ensures fast rendering. The Ionic Framework has been used for the styling of the web app. To give the user a feeling of content being loaded, we show a loader using react-loading-skeleton after which the backend sends the data using Axios. The state management of the user selections has been done using React Hooks.
